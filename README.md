# Description
This is a React app that uses GraphQL on the back-end, along with Apollo Server and MongoDB via Mongoose. It also uses Google's Book API to fetch books, which a user can save to a book list on their account. Each fetched book has a title, authors, description, image, and a link to the book on Google. User accounts require a valid email address, username, and password. JWT are used to keep track of logged-in users and whether they need to log in again before proceeding to other site functionalities.
